# <Refactor Challenge 1>

## What was achieved

This was a personal challenge to fix the link element to properly move down to the desired location
as well as clean up repetative css elements to shorten the css page.

With this project, I learned different ways to consolidate similar lines into shorter section as well as how 
to bug fix lines that don't do what they are inteded to do.
